        <h2>How to Create a Character</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the cozy corner of character creation! Here at The Cozy Kobold, we guide you through the steps of building a character that fits your world, your story, and your table. Whether you're a daring rogue, a bookish wizard, or a lovable kobold, this guide will help you bring them to life.</p>
          <p>Pick a Race
             Choose a fantasy race for your character (like human, elf, dwarf, tiefling). Each race gives you special abilities and bonuses.</p>

             <p>Choose a Class
             Your class defines what your character can do. Examples: fighter (good at fighting), wizard (casts spells), rogue (sneaky), cleric (healer). Each class has unique skills and abilities.</p>

             <p>Decide Your Ability Scores
             These are your character’s core stats:
             Strength (physical power)
             Dexterity (agility)
             Constitution (health and stamina)
             Intelligence (Book smarts)
             Wisdom (Street smarts)
             Charisma (charm and influence)
             You can roll dice, use a point-buy system, or use a standard set of numbers.</p>

             <p>Pick a Background
             Backgrounds give your character a history and extra skills or tools, like being a soldier, noble, or artisan.</p>

             <p>Select Equipment
             Your class and background usually give you starting weapons, armor, and tools.</p>

             <p>Choose Spells (if applicable)
             If your class can cast spells (like wizard or cleric), pick your starting spells.</p>

             <p>Fill in Details
             Give your character a name, personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws to bring them to life.</p>

             <p>Calculate Key Stats
             Hit Points (how much damage you can take)
             Armor Class (how hard you are to hit)
             Attack bonuses and saving throws based on class and stats.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Rolling Your Stats</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to determine your character’s abilities! The most classic method is to roll 4d6 and drop the lowest die, but some tables prefer point buy or a standard array for balanced play. Whatever method you use, we encourage creativity—sometimes the best heroes have the quirkiest stats!</p>
